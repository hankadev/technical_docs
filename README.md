# Technical documentation page
This is my implementation of [Free Code Camp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Technical Documentation project.

[view in browser](https://hanny21.github.io/technical_docs/)

## Objective
Built an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL/).
Fulfill the below user stories. Give it your own personal style.

User stories:
* __User Story #1:__ I can see a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
* __User Story #2:__ Within the `#main-doc` element, I can see several `section` elements, each with a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of 5.
* __User Story #3:__ The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
* __User Story #4:__  Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each `header` contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The `section` that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding `id="Javascript_and_Java"`).
* __User Story #5:__ The `.main-section` elements should contain at least 10 `p` elements total (not each).
* __User Story #6:__ The `.main-section` elements should contain at least 5 `code` elements total (not each).
* __User Story #7:__ The `.main-section` elements should contain at least 5 `li` items total (not each).
* __User Story #8:__ I can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`.
* __User Story #9:__ The navbar element should contain one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
* __User Story #10:__ Additionally, the navbar should contain link (`a`) elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`.
* __User Story #11:__ The `header` element in the navbar must come before any link (`a`) elements in the navbar.
* __User Story #12:__ Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section` (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
* __User Story #13:__ When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `main-doc` element (e.g. If I click on a `nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element that has that id and contains the corresponding `header`.
* __User Story #14:__ On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
* __User Story #15:__ My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.
